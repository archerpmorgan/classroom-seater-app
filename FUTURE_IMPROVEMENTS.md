# Future Improvements for Seating Chart Generator

## Planned Features to Add

### 0. restore after manual drag
- Create a button to restore the layout to the first generated positions. The purpose of this is that I may get overzealous dragging kids around and want to have everything put back to the nice orderly starting postiions. 


### 1. Interactive Layout/Strategy Selection Flowchart
- Create an interactive decision tree to help teachers choose the best layout and grouping strategy
- Guide questions could include:
  - What's the main activity for today? (lecture, group work, discussion, test)
  - Do you have students who need language support?
  - Are there behavioral concerns to address?
  - What's your primary goal? (engagement, focus, collaboration, etc.)
- Visual flowchart that recommends optimal layout + strategy combinations
- Could be implemented as a modal dialog or separate page
