# Future Improvements for Seating Chart Generator

## Planned Features to Add





### 3. Interactive Layout/Strategy Selection Flowchart
- Create an interactive decision tree to help teachers choose the best layout and grouping strategy
- Guide questions could include:
  - What's the main activity for today? (lecture, group work, discussion, test)
  - Do you have students who need language support?
  - Are there behavioral concerns to address?
  - What's your primary goal? (engagement, focus, collaboration, etc.)
- Visual flowchart that recommends optimal layout + strategy combinations
- Could be implemented as a modal dialog or separate page



### 5. Enhanced Print Functionality
- Improve current print layout for better paper output
- Add print options:
  - Include/exclude student metadata
  - Different paper sizes (A4, Letter, etc.)
  - Portrait vs landscape orientation
  - Multiple charts per page
- Consider adding a dedicated print preview page
- Optimize styling specifically for print media


## Technical Considerations
- **Smart Grouping Logic**: Add conditional rendering and state management for layout-dependent features
- **Icon System**: Implement consistent icon library usage and visual hierarchy
- **Privacy mode**: Add state management for view mode toggle
- **CSV export**: Use existing CSV libraries, format current seating data
- **Print improvements**: CSS media queries and print-specific styling
- **Flowchart**: Consider using a library like React Flow or build custom decision tree component
